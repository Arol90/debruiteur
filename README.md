# denoiser
ðŸ“¸ A little program that allows you to slightly denoise your image using a median filter

/!\ This program only works with .png

You just have to open "denoiser.py" with python, everything will be explained (in french)

After using this program, the denoised image will be saved in the same folder where you opened it
